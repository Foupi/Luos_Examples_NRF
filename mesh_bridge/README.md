# Mesh Bridge

Luos container linking several Luos networks through a Bluetooth Mesh
network.

##Â Description

The Mesh Bridge container is of a custom type, named `MESH_BRIDGE_MOD`,
which if not defined to a precise value corresponds to `LUOS_LAST_TYPE`.

It can manage the following messages:

* `MESH_BRIDGE_EXT_RTB_CMD`: Engages a routing table extension
procedure.

* `MESH_BRIDGE_PRINT_INTERNAL_TABLES`: Prints the internal tables on
the debug channel of the host board _(for debugging purposes)_.

* `MESH_BRIDGE_CLEAR_INTERNAL_TABLES`: Clears the local and remote
container tables _(called if new containers or nodes have been added to
the local Luos network)_.

* `MESH_BRIDGE_FILL_LOCAL_CONTAINER_TABLE`: Fills the local container
table with relevant entries of the local routing table _(necessary for
extending the routing table)_.

* `MESH_BRIDGE_UPDATE_INTERNAL_TABLES`: Updates the local IDs of the
entries from the local and remote container tables in prediction of a
detection run by the container with the given ID _(necessary if another
container runs a detection; payload is a container ID as an_
`uint16_t`_)_.

The Mesh Bridge container will send the following messages:

* `MESH_BRIDGE_EXT_RTB_COMPLETE`: Sent after the routing table extension
procedure is complete. If this procedure had been requested by another
container, then this message is sent to the source container as a
response; else, if it was triggered by another Luos network extending
its own routing table, it is sent as a broadcast message to the whole
Luos network.

* `MESH_BRIDGE_INTERNAL_TABLES_CLEARED`: Sent after local and remote
container tables have been cleared.

* `MESH_BRIDGE_LOCAL_CONTAINER_TABLE_FILLED`: Sent after filling the
local container table, contains the number of entries stored _(payload
is the number of entries as an_ `uint16_t`_)_.

* `MESH_BRIDGE_INTERNAL_TABLES_UPDATED`: Sent after the local IDs of
entries from the local and remote container tables have been updated.

The first Mesh Bridge message is indexed at a value named
`MESH_BRIDGE_MSG_BEGIN` which, if not defined, is equal to
`LUOS_PROTOCOL_NB`; a last entry in the command enum, named
`MESH_BRIDGE_MSG_END`, signals the end of Mesh Bridge command values.

## Container tables

In order to keep track of whether each container entry of the routing
table represents a container hosted by the local or a remote Luos
network, the Mesh Bridge container implements two data structures
containing data about local and remote containers.

The **local container table** stores information about local containers
exposed to other Luos networks:
* The _routing table entry_ exposed to other networks, as a
`routing_table_t`.
* The _id of the container_ on the local network, as an `uint16_t`.

Some kinds of containers can be excluded from this table when it is
filled: for instance, exposing the Mesh Bridge container would be
redundant.

The **remote container table** stores information about remote
containers exposed by other Luos networks:
* The _routing table entry_ exposed by the remote network, as a
`routing_table_t`.
* The _Bluetooth Mesh unicast address_ of the Bluetooth Mesh node
hosting the Mesh Bridge container instance in the remote network, as an
`uint16_t`.
* The _id of the container_ on the local network, as an `uint16_t`.
* The _local container instance_, as a `container_t*`.

Good management of these tables through Luos messages is crucial to the
behaviour of an application:

* Before engaging the routing table extension procedure, the local
container table **must** have been filled using the
`MESH_BRIDGE_FILL_LOCAL_CONTAINER_TABLE` message; else, local containers
could not be exposed and message exchanges would not be possible.

* When a container is to run a detection, the container tables **must**
be updated beforehand using a `MESH_BRIDGE_UPDATE_INTERNAL_TABLES`
message containing the ID of the container running the detection; else,
the local IDs stored in the internal tables may become wrong, which
will trigger malfunctions when trying to send messages to remote
containers.

* When new containers or nodes are added to the Luos network:
  * The container tables **must** be cleared using the
`MESH_BRIDGE_CLEAR_INTERNAL_TABLES` message _before_ a detection is run;
else, the behaviour of the remote container table could be severaly
affected.
  * The local container table **must** be filled using the
`MESH_BRIDGE_FILL_LOCAL_CONTAINER_TABLE` message _after_ the internal
tables are cleared and the detection is run; else, as the routing table
does not differentiate local and remote containers, remote containers
might be exposed as local ones, which would result in undefined
behaviour.

## Routing table extension

The Mesh Bridge container can "extend" the routing table of its network
by adding entries corresponding to containers hosted by remote networks
connected to the same Bluetooth Mesh network. This procedure is
performed using the "Luos RTB" Bluetooth Mesh model defined in the
`common/mesh_models/luos_rtb_model` folder.

There are two ways this procedure can be engaged:

* By receiving a `MESH_BRIDGE_EXT_RTB_CMD` message:
  * The source container ID is stored by the Mesh Bridge container.
  * The remote container table is cleared.
  * A Luos RTB `GET` request is sent through the internal Luos RTB model
instance, and a timer is started.
  * For each Luos RTB `STATUS` reply received:
    * A remote container table entry is created corresponding to the
received entry:
      * The received routing table entry and source node unicast address
are stored.
      * The local ID is deduced from a detection simulation from the
Mesh Bridge container.
      * The local container instance is created.
    * The timer is reset.
  * At timeout, it is considered that every remote network has sent all
of its exposed entries.
  * Local container entries are published in Luos RTB `STATUS` messages.
  * Once publication of the last local container entry is complete, the
ID of the source container after a detection by the Mesh Bridge
container is computed, as well as those of the local container table
entries.
  * The Mesh Bridge container runs a detection to add remote containers
to the network routing table.
  * A `MESH_BRIDGE_EXT_RTB_COMPLETE` message is sent to the source
container.

* By receiving a Luos RTB `GET` request:
  * The entries of the remote container table bearing the unicast
address of the Bluetooth Mesh node emitting the request _(source node)_
are removed.
  * Local container entries are sent to the source node in Luos RTB
`STATUS` replies.
  * Once reply of the last local container entry is complete, the Mesh
Bridge container expects to receive the entries exposed by the source
node, and starts a timer.
  * For each Luos RTB `STATUS` message received:
    * A remote container table entry is created corresponding to the
received entry:
      * The received routing table entry and source node unicast address
are stored.
      * The local ID is deduced from a detection simulation from the
Mesh Bridge container.
      * The local container instance is created.
    * The timer is reset.
  * At timeout, it is considered that the source node has sent all of
its exposed entries.
  * The local IDs of the local container table entries after a detection
by the Mesh Bridge container are computed.
  * The Mesh Bridge container runs a detection to add remote containers
to the network routing table.
  * A `MESH_BRIDGE_EXT_RTB_COMPLETE` is sent in broadcast to the whole
Luos network.
